# Human-Activity-Recogntion
This is a research project completed for Math 496 taught by Professor Ben Adcock at SFU.
The goal of this project is to implement techniques learned in class (and some new ones) to tackle a data science project.
Our work is based off of the dat set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set "from the UTI machine learning repository.
I worked on this project together with Alice Roberts.
